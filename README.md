I’ve been fascinated by **Hopfield Neural Networks** for a long time and finally found time to reimplement one. This repository contains a well-documented, cleanly structured Hopfield Network. I drew heavy inspiration from [Ancient repo](https://github.com/takyamamoto/Hopfield-Network).

*`takyamamoto`* hadn’t updated that repo in a while, and it had some bugs, so I fixed those, updated it for modern libraries, and refactored the code into modular utils, training, and network files. My next plans are to turn this into a Python library and write a blog post by the weekend.
